Crazy ideas that shouldn't be forgotten, more details on their .md files

### Project Athena (Colaborative Education Platform)

There are already great educational platforms providing great assistance to students everywhere such as Udemy, Datacamp, Udacity, edX, School of Ai, with the last two on the list being almost completely accessible for free, but I think we can do more. We need a open-source platform that supports a huge collaborative community and anyone can easily contribute in the smallest details. Since I am studying currently in a free (at least for now) University in Brazil (University of SÃ£o Paulo - USP) and if we can make this project have a big impact on the university, we will various steps closer to providing free education for every one. 

### Brazil's Government Spending Analysis

We already have access to some API's about government spending, so I want to do an analysis of this highly dimensional data and look for measures that could be more effective and less damaging in the long term.

### Inteligent systems for correction of essays

For my PhD, I will actively participate in the development of this system, we aim to use this in the correction of essays of students participating in the ingression test of USP, organized by FUVEST. Our fist attempt on this NLP project, will be in the creation of a neural network (probably LSTM) that can "learn" to give an score on the essay based on the score parameters determined by FUVEST. 


### Trapfy.ai (Music Style-Transfer)

Applying the style transfer technique in pictures already is popular, so I aiming to help to use the same proccess in music and try to understand what aspects of the song a neural network needs to extract in order to make this effective. I know that there are some works with this idea, but I didn't checked them yet.
