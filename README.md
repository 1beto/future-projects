# future-projects
Just scraps of crazy ideas that shouldn't be forgotten, more details on their .md files (if it has one), I would also love recommendations on all projects, or even new ones!

### Project Athena (Colaborative Education Platform)

There are already great educational platforms providing great assistance to students everywhere such as Udemy, Datacamp, Udacity, edX, School of Ai, with the last two on the list being almost completely accessible for free, but I think we can do more. We need a open-source platform that supports a huge collaborative community and anyone can easily contribute in the smallest details. Since I am studying currently in a free (at least for now) University in Brazil (University of São Paulo - USP) and if we can make this project have a big impact on the university, we will various steps closer to providing free education for every one. 

### Brazil's Government Spending Analysis

We are facing the possibility of having a disastrous pension reform in the country, which aims to save about R$ 860 billions  (US$ 220 billions) in the next 10 years. We already have access to some API's about government spending, so I want to do an analysis of this high dimensional data and look for measures that could be more effective and less damaging in the long term.

### Inteligent systems for correction of essays

For my PhD, I will actively participate in the development of this system, we aim to use this in the correction of essays of students participating in the ingression test of USP, organized by FUVEST. Our fist attempt on this NLP project, will be in the creation of a neural network (probably LSTM) that can "learn" to give an score on the essay based on the score parameters determined by FUVEST. 

### One Belt One Road Analysis

China is making the biggest infrastructure project in the history of mankind. I want to make an analysis of this project, especially it's impact in underdeveloped countries and in global climate.

### São Carlos Municipal University

São Carlos is on of the greatest technological poles in Latin America. One of the biggest reasons for that is the fact that this 250 thousand habitant city has two universities, both are public universities, one managed by the state and one is managed by the union. Adding a third university, managed by the state, will bring an enourmous impact on the development of the city, making it less vulnerable, in the long term, of governamental crisis and also contemplating the fact that this city should be the best technological pole. In the short term, we also have the advantage of providing free education for the local comunity.


### Trapfy.ai (Music Style-Transfer)

Applying the style transfer technique in pictures already is popular, so I aiming to help to use the same proccess in music and try to understand what aspects of the song a neural network needs to extract in order to make this effective. I know that there are some works with this idea, but I didn't checked them yet.
